# flutter_expenses

This Flutter application hosts a list of expenses, where each expense includes:
- a note of what it is
- a cost
- and a date that it occurred

You can scroll through the list and add expenses to it.

The list is able to handle an infinite number of expenses and only load the relevant ones as they render on the screen.
